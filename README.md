# Web-Security-Academy

First things first
Thanks a lot to Rana Khalil (@rkhal101) for the youtube lessons that taught me the first steps to create my own scripts, solve the labs and how to take my firsts notes.

I’ll share my scripts here to help anyone that is wanting to solve the web security academy labs using python too.
I’m just a beginner so if you see anything that could be better, let me know.
